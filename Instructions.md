# RaDeCC Reader
## Version 2.0.0

This program calculates:
- Fully corrected dpm(223Ra)/1000 L and dpm(224Ra)/1000 L with propagated uncertainties for each read
- Excess radium-223 and excess radium-224 activities for each sample
- Supporting thorium-228 and actinium-227 for each sample
- Estimated dpm(226Ra)/1000 L (via the rate of 222Rn ingrowth)
- Detector efficiencies (Using 227-Actinium and 228-Thorium Standards)


Required input:
- RaDeCC system read files from samples, thorium-228 standard and blanks (background measurements). Actinium-227 standards are optional as 219-channel efficiency can also be determined via 220-channel efficiency.
- Logsheet with sample collection metadata (as .txt files)
- User input via the Graphical User Interface (GUI) 

## Prerequisites

Hardware Requirements: 2 x 64-bit 2.8 GHz 8.00 GT/s CPUs, 32 GB RAM (or 16 GB of 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM), 300 GB Storage. 

Written in Python 3.6, RaDeCC Reader (235.7 MB) is available on GitHub (https://github.com/oxradreader/RaDeCC_Reader)


**It is advised to run the program with the data in the *Example_Data* Folder first in order to check that the program itself is functioning properly. See 'Example Data Input:' comments throughout instructions**


## Preparing Input Data

### Logsheet formatting

- Logsheets should be formatted such that each row represents a sample and each column a variable such as sample name, latitude, sample volume etc. (See Example_Logsheet.csv)
- Logsheets must be in a comma-separated value (.csv) format.
- Sample names in the logsheet must match the sample names used in filenames.
- If using sub-sample names/values, those in the logsheet must match those in the filenames(e.g. individual sub-samples at different depths at a string of locations, each location being a sample, each depth being a sub-sample)

**IMPORTANT: Sample/sub-sample names must be unique to each sample/sub-sample and a sample/sub-sample name must not be contained within another sample/sub-sample name (e.g. 'sample2' can be found within 'sample20').**
**The easiest way to accomplish unique sample names that are not contained within eachother is to use a set number of digits. For example: instead of [Sample2, Sample20] use [Sample002, Sample020].**


### File naming conventions
- For linear sample sets (e.g. 1-dimensional surface sampling), read file names need to follow the format (addition details such as date or read number can be included but will not be used by the program): 
		
		[Sample]-[Detector_Name].txt
	
	- [Sample] : this is the name of your sample, e.g. StnX001 (N.B. samples need to be numbered 001-999 e.g. StnX001 to StnX999)
	- [Detector_Name] : this is the name of the detector used for this particular read of this sample.
	
	For example:
		
		 StnX042-detector1-250119.txt


	- For sample sets that contain sub-samples (e.g. multiple depth profiles creating a 2-dimensional transect), sample read file names need to follow the format:
	
		[Sample]-[Sub-Sample]-[Detector_Name].txt


	- [Sample] : this is the name of your sample, e.g. StnX001 (N.B. samples need to be numbered 001-999 e.g. StnX001 to StnX999)
	- [Sub-Sample] : this is the name of the sub sample, for example if one sample contains a number of sub-samples at different depths or times this could be the sub-sample depth or time. These values or names should match those in the logsheet(s)
	- [Detector_Name] : this is the name of the detector used for this particular read of this sample.
	
	For example:
	
		 StnX042-1700A-detector1-250119.txt
	
	- For 227-actinium standard, 228-thorium standard and blank reads, the following file name format must be followed:

		[Standard_or_Blank_Type]-[Detector_Name].txt

		- [Standard_or_Blank_Type] : this is the name of the standard or blank cartridge ( e.g 228-thorium standard = thstd, 227-actinium standard = acstd and blank = blank)
		- [Detector_Name] : this is the name of the detector used for this particular read of this sample.

	For example:
	
		 thstd-detector1.txt
	
	The addition of dates to filenames is advisable in order to differentiate them. In this case add dates to file names without spaces or slashes.

## Downloading RaDeCC_Reader

- The RaDeCC_Reader application can be found on the 'Releases' page of the RaDeCC_Reader repository in the 'Assets' drop down menu (https://github.com/oxradreader/RaDeCC_Reader/releases)
- Each release includes:
	1.  RaDeCC_Reader_OS_vX_X.zip file containing the application itself
	2.  'Source code' : This comes as a .zip folder anda  .tar.gz file. Both contain a copy of the files in the repository which inclludes: Example Input data, example output files and the python script behind the application.

- To get the program running:
	1. Download the RaDeCC_Reader_OS_vX_X.zip file containing the application itself
	2. Open the RaDeCC_Reader_OS_vX_X file (this should result in a terminal window appearing with some code and then after a few moments the GUI should appear)
	3. Fill in all the fields in the GUI as per guidance below.
	4. Click 'Run RaDeCC Reader'
	5. When 'Run Complete' appears below the 'Run RaDeCC Reader' button, your corrected sample activities are ready!

## Using the RaDeCC Reader GUI

Once the GUI window has appeared the data entry fields can be filled in:

**The first time the RaDeCC Reader GUI is used all fields must be filled out manually. Entries can however be saved before running the program and reloaded for later runs of the program.**

**It is advised to run the program with the data in the *Example_Data* Folder first in order to check that the program itself is functioning properly. See 'Example Data Input:' comments throughout instructions**

1. Complete Panel 1 entry fields:

	- *Input directory* : The folder which contains the read files and logsheet that the user wants to input to the RaDeCC Reader.

		**Example Data Input**: The *Example_Data* Folder

	- *Output directory* : The folder in which the RaDeCC Reader will place its output folder of calculation results.

		**Example Data Input**: The folder where you would like outputs to be saved.

	- *Logsheet File* : The .csv file containing the logsheet for the files in the 'Input directory'.

		**Example Data Input**: *'Example_Logsheet.csv'* in the *'Example_Data'* folder.

	- *DDMMYYYY Format* : This box is ticked if all read files and logsheets are dated using the the days before months convention. For months before days leave the box unticked.

		**Example Data Input**: This box should be *ticked*

	- *Contains sub-samples*: This box is ticked if the dataset contains sub-samples ('Branched') as opposed to unticked if the dataset does not contain sub-samples ('Linear')

		**Example Data Input**: This box should be *ticked*

	- *Spike Sensitivity*: The RaDeCC Reader defines 'spikes' (often electrical) by the number of counts higher the 'spike' interval is compared to the previous interval. Here the user can set this count threshold. If spike removal is not desired then the spike sensitivity number can be set very high (as is default). For more detail see 'Electrical spike detection and removal' below.

		**Example Data Input**: Leave this field as the *default value: 10000000*

	- *Equilibration time (mins)*: When calculating the slope of radon-222 ingrowth in the total channel of a read a portion of time at the start of the read is ignored as the activity of radon-222 is equilibrating around the RaDeCC apparatus. The length of time that is ignored when calculating radon-222 ingrowth is set by the 'Equilibration time'. By default this feature is 'off' and therefore set to 0 minutes.

		**Example Data Input**: Leave Equilibration time set to *default value: 0*

- The number of thorium-228 standards, actinium-227 standards, background standards and detectors is then indicated in the appropriate fields.

	**Example Data Input**:
	- No. of 228Th Standards : *2*
	- No. of 227Ac Standards : *2*

### Saving and Loading RaDeCC Reader GUI Inputs
 - To save inputs to the RaDeCC Reader GUI, click the 'Check Inputs' button followed by the 'Save Field Inputs' button.
 - To load previous inputs click on the 'Load Saved Entries' button and navigate to and select the RR_GUI_entries_HHMMSS_YYYY-MM-DD.csv file. This will have been saved in the *Output directory* selected when the previous inputs were saved. Then 'Check' the inputs and click 'Continue'. When Panel 2 appears click 'Load Saved entries' at the top of panel 2 in order to load the rest of the saved entries.

## Output from RaDeCC Reader

### The program will output the following files in .csv format

**Important: When checking output data, it is important to check the detector efficiencies and errors as well as the individual read results in the 'Read_Results_Dataframe'. Errors in either of these will lead to errors in final excess calculations**

#### Dataframes (Found in the Dataframes Folder)
- A main table (.csv format) containing all metadata from logsheets as well as values for each level of the Garcia-Solsona corrections and uncertainty propagations, ending with dpm/1000L for both 223Ra and 224Ra as well as an estimation of 226Ra based on 222Rn ingrowth. All this is displayed for each read of each sample, ready for easy data-manipulation in Microsoft Excel.
- A summary table of detector efficiencies. 
- A table of efficiencies for each channel, detailing the efficiency calculated for each standard read.
- An output logsheet, the amalgamation of all input logsheets.

#### Plots (Found in the Read_Plots Folder)
- A plot of counts per minute for the total, radon-219 and radon-220 channels over the course of each read. Spikes in counts per minute (any counts that exceeded the default spike_sensitivity constant) have been removed.

#### Error Flagging

- After the files have been copied from the source directory(source_dir) to the newly constructed original directory (original_dir), the program will report the number of files not copied (should be 0)
- If a spike ( when the *spike_sensitivity* is exceeded in either the 219 or 220 channel) is detected in a readfile, that interval is removed and the summary values are calculated without them. The user is notified via the terminal or console as well as in the .csv file contain the output results
- If the read runtime is < 600 minutes the radium-226 activity will not be calculated and the user will be notified via the 'Errors' column in the read results dataframe and the sample results dataframe.
- The adequacy of a read for the quantification of radium-223 or radium-224 activity as determined by the logic outlined by Diego-Feliu et al. (2020) is assessed. In the event that a read is not adequate for the quantification of an isotope, the percentage of that read's intervals that are affected is logged in the read results  and sample results dataframes.
